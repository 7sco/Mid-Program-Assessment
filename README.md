# Mid-Program-Assessment

Got up to part3 and got stuck on the part where the item in RecyclerView is clicked, it creates a new Fragment.
Still trying to work on getting the getSupportFragmentManager() to work in ViewHolder.

AsyncTask was easy to implements, SharedPreferences always take some time, but still understand the concept.

The hard part is a fragment in the recyclerView?
